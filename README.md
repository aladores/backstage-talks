# Backstage Talks - Frontend Pratice 
Live: [aladores.github.io/backstage-talks/](aladores.github.io/backstage-talks/)

This website is a practice project from [FrontendPractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/backstage-talks)

It is a recreation of the [Backstage Talks Magazine website](https://backstagetalks.com/) 

## Built With
This website was built with just regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Using a framework/library could have been useful in some cases. For example: 
- Creating a component for each book section, so I only have to edit each component once.
- Or dynamic conditional rendering to show if a book is in stock.

However, the website is simple since its primarily a single page and does not seem to get updated very often. Only minimal changes to the source code are needed if a new magazine issue is added or if the stock status changes.
